## Objects

Special type of data --> stores multiple datas and complex entities.

Creation: With curly braces `{}` + optional list of properties

Property = "key: value" --> key = `"string"` (property name) --> value = any type of data

Empty object can be created using 2 different syntaxes:

- ```javascript
    let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
  ```

- ```javascript
    let user = {}; // "object literal" syntax
  ```

Curly braces are the most common way to do it.
