## Loops: while and for

Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.

## `while` loops

While loops repeat the code while the `condition` is `true`.

It is written like this:

    ```javascript
        while (condition) {
            // loop body
        }
    ```

An execution of a loop body is called an iteration.

Any expression or variable can be a loop expression the condition is converted into a boolean type by `while (...)`
