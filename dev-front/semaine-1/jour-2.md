## Code Structure

### Blocks of code

1. **Statements**

Statements are the structure that perform actions.

We can have as much statements as we want within our code.

#### *Example*

    ```javascript
    alert("Hello World");
    alert("This is a statement");
    ```

2. **Semicolons**

Semicolons are used to separate statements, however, in many situations, Javascript understand a line break as a semicolon.

***HOWEVER***, there are multiple instances where this isn't the case.

In the case of an incomplete expression, like a mathematical operation, Javascript understands that you shouldn't put semicolons at th line breaks.

There are cases where JS fails to assume a semicolon where there really should be.

Unfortunately, those errors are quite hard to fix. Fortunately, they don't occur that often.

> It is recommended to put semicolons at the end of each sentence regardless as it is much safer.
